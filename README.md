A simple and clean ASP.NET Core MVC web application for managing car listings. Built in **2023**, this project allows users to add, edit, and remove cars from a database using a friendly web interface.

This was one of my first full-stack projects and helped me understand the flow of a complete MVC-based application from backend to UI.
